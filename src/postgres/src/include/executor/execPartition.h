 *								(= 'partitions_oid'/'partitions' array length)
 * parent_child_tupconv_maps	Array of TupleConversionMap objects with one
 *								entry for every leaf partition (required to
 *								convert tuple from the root table's rowtype to

 *								checked if a map is required, or it was
 *								determined to be required.
 * subplan_partition_offsets	Integer array ordered by UPDATE subplans. Each
