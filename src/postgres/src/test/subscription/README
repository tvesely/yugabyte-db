Regression tests for subscription/logical replication
=====================================================

This directory contains a test suite for subscription/logical replication.

Running the tests
=================

    make check

or

    make installcheck

This requires the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.

Running the tests creates a temporary installation (in the case of
"check"), and some tests may create one or multiple nodes, for the
purpose of the tests.

Running installcheck requires the hstore extension to be installed.
