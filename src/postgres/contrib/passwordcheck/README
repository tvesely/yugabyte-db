passwordcheck has been replaced by passwordcheck_extra.
However the name of the plugin continues to be passwordcheck because the team
decided that it will be confusing to have two plugins for the same function.

The steps followed to replace the plugin are:

* Choose commit referred below as subsequent commits add support for PG15.
* Overwrite passwordcheck.c with passwordcheck_extra.c (using cp)
* Remove all occurrences of "_extra" as the name of the plugin is unchanged.

Tests from passwordcheck (with some changes) and passwordcheck_extra are also
run.
