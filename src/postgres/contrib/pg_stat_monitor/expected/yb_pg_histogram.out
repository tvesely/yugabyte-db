-- TODO: The following inserts works well. However the number of calls that are
-- displayed for the query,
--
-- SELECT query, calls FROM pg_stat_monitor ORDER BY query COLLATE "C";
--
-- varies every time. Sometimes, there are two entries for the same query
-- for which the sum of them is equal to the total number of times SELECT has
-- been executed. Hence we comment these.
